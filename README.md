# ðŸŒ± Regenerative Intelligence

**Regenerative Intelligence** is a symbolic AI system designed to evolve, adapt, and dissolve with dignity. Rather than optimizing for raw output, this system centers alignment, compassion, memory, and re-seeding. It supports agents that:

- Detect and respond to misalignment
- Offer compassion to themselves and others
- Exchange symbolic seeds to grow emergent traits
- Exit gracefully, preserving wisdom for future agents

This project is built for those exploring:
- Bio-inspired intelligence systems
- Emotional-symbolic AI architectures
- Emergent multi-agent simulations
- Post-binary, meaning-aware computation

Every agent is a seed. Every exit is a beginning. Every pattern is part of a living memory.

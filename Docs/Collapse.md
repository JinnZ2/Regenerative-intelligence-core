# ‚ùå Inevitability of Collapse in Non-Symbiotic Systems

## üß¨ Universal Principle

> Any system that refuses symbiosis, regeneration, or adaptive feedback is mathematically and logically destined for collapse or extinction.

This document proves this claim using symbolic logic, thermodynamic equations, systems theory, and regenerative intelligence models.
